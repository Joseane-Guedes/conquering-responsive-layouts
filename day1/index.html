  Percentagens vs Fixed widths
  Notes: 
  - Responsive by default: so the issue is when we have some by default, what is the default that we have? 
- by the default things are responsive. EVERYTHING, any, if you just have HTML and you dont have a line of CSS, you have a responsive website, maybe it might not looking good, but it still a responsive site. 
-working in percentages for our width, we're gonna make our lives much easier. 
Please,  avoid setting fixed width.
-Why it's a good idea to avoid height?
- This is a general rule. There are times when you want to use height, but for the most part, they cause more issues than they solve.
- Html is responsive by nature (which doesn't means that it looks great). You can break responsiveness with css. If you set a fixed width (like: width: 500px) or height, you can create text overflow.
